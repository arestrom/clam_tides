**Disclaimer:** Tide predictions in this application are generated using the rtide R package and are not suitable for navigation!

### Introduction 

This application is intended as a planning tool for the intertidal shellfish management team at the WDFW Port Townsend office. Daily tide predictions on the *TIDE PLOT* page are generated using the rtide R package. Predictions are calculated based on harmonics data from NOAA. For efficiency, the data on the *HIGH-LOW ONLY* page are derived from an internal dataset. The high-low data spans 1970-2056. 

Locations for tide predictions in *Table 1* can be selected using either the drop-down menu, or by clicking on the map. Beach polygons on the map are based on the 2018 beach layer used by our aerial survey staff. The polygon boundaries indicated on the map are not legal boundaries! They have only been included for planning purposes and were originally designed to facilitate data entry. Do not assume these beaches allow public access.

For now, only the time of tides at individual beaches have been corrected. Tide heights are still those of the reference stations. While the timing of tides varies considerably from north to south in Puget Sound, the tide height varies relatively little between reference and subordinate stations. Tide time corrections for beaches are based on a combination of NOAA subordinate tide station data and data generated by a University of Washington Dept of Oceanography tides model.

The primary difference in tide time corrections between this application and corrections published by NOAA is for Zelatchet Point. NOAA data assumes the correction at Zelatchet Point should be -5 minutes relative to Seattle. However, nearly all other NOAA corrections in this stretch of the Canal, including Bangor, Seabeck, and Pt Whitney varies by two minutes or less from Seattle. NOAAs Zelatchet correction may be incorrect. This is corroborated by the UW Puget Sound tides model. Consequently, the Zelatchet correction used by this application has been changed to +1. Segments from the UW tides model were used to extrapolate corrections between stations in several other places, but with the exception of Zelatchet Point, corrections are all based on data published by NOAA for subordinate stations. 

Future plans to include tide height corrections as well. Requires more work to compile and model corrections.

Include definitions of tide strata
